## Capture
- [ ] Compare Trinity Actual Surcharges to what proper calculations would be and let Gregg know what I've found. ()

## Notes

- Meeting with @Kyle and @Jarod on Rail Surcharges
	- Locked Customers - we have to honor pricing
		- Trinity
		- Eagle
		- AITX (though we can get increases through)
	- Trinity Surcharge structure
		- we can update pricing every year
		- The Material, Currency Exchange, and Freight Surcharge is
			- Calculated from a baseline of Oct. 2020 index values
		- Tariff Surcharge
			- Been in place since well before Kyle, so it's not a TARIFF Surcharge, more of an overall import surcharge. It's 8%
	- We looked at Trinity's surcharge spreadsheet and the material index calculations are incorrect and seem to be causing extremely high surcharges that we shouldn't have been charging.
