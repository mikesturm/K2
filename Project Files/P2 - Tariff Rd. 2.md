# Project: Tariff Round 2 Increase

**Status:** Active

**Purpose:** Implement and communicate the second round of tariff-related price adjustments with clarity and coordination.

### Plan

```
START → Identify impacted spend (HTS 74–76 lines on the customer's BOM)
   ↓
Check what they received in Round 1
   ├─ If Round 1 = Surcharge only → Prefer **Piece Price Increase** this round (if feasible)
   └─ Otherwise → Choose best path
   ↓
Pick approach in Tracker (Column H)
   ├─ A) Piece Price Increase – AM owns pricing
   ├─ B) Piece Price Increase – Sales + AM align on strategy
   ├─ C) Surcharge Increase – Sales proposes & negotiates
   └─ D) TBD → escalate in huddle for guidance
   ↓
Build case file (customer-facing):
   • One-paragraph rationale (Sec. 232 50%; copper adds brass; content-based)  
   • Impacted SKUs & % copper/alum content (if known)  
   • Net effect **after** assuming 20% China IEEPA removal (if applicable)
   ↓
Customer conversation → negotiate → update Tracker & ERP
   ↓
Close: Confirm effective date, PO coverage, and update quotes
END
```
