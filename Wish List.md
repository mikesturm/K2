1. ~~Associate Notes with customers or people, like a CRM and see them on a People page?~~
	1. ~~The current dataview setup requires me to~~ 
2. Have items tasks within a project file get tagged with the correct "#P" file based on being in that file, so that when task mover moves them, they're tagged.
3. How do we handle commitments?
4. How do we handle hard due dates?
5. How do we handle target (soft) dates?
6. Autosuggest people tags
7. Handle duplication of tasks when they exist in notes--now that we have Projects.md assign this task ID.
	1. perhaps we just have task-mover assign the task ID? But that wouldn't solve the issue b/c it's not assigning it BACK to the source of the task (unless we have it do that)
8. Fix issue with Task mover where it pulls in the same task if you apply tags within kinetic-tasks but it exists elsewhere without them.
